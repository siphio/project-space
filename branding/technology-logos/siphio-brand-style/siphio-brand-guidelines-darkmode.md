### Color Rules

1. **Background is always warm charcoal** (#1C1917) — never pure black (#000000)
2. **Terracotta is the hero** — use as largest color block accent
3. **Mustard is the sidekick** — smaller accent shapes, never dominant
4. **Line art and text are warm cream** (#F3F0E9) — never pure white
5. **No gradients** — all color blocks are flat, solid, matte
6. **No neon or electric colors** — keep everything warm and organic
7. **Maintain warmth** — dark mode should feel cozy, not cold or sterile

---

## Typography

### Primary Typefaces

**Headlines:** Serif typeface (Tiempos, Georgia, Freight Text, or similar)
- Warm, readable, academic credibility
- Used for main headlines and titles
- Warm Cream (#F3F0E9) color

**Body Text:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, Styrene, or similar)

- Used for subtext and descriptions
- Stone Gray (#A8A29E) for secondary text

### Typography Rules

1. Headlines should feel editorial, not corporate
2. Avoid all-caps except for small labels
3. Generous line spacing for readability
4. Text should have breathing room — never crowded
5. Serif for headlines creates academic warmth
6. Mix serif headlines with sans-serif body text
7. Cream text on dark background — warm contrast, not harsh

---

## Illustration Style

### Core Characteristics

**Hand-Drawn Cream Line Art**
- Continuous line drawing style
- Imperfect, organic, human-made feeling
- Single weight or slight variation in line thickness
- Warm Cream (#F3F0E9) ink on dark background or on color blocks

**Solid Color Blocks**
- Organic, rounded, blob-like shapes
- Imperfect edges (not perfectly geometric)
- Flat, matte, no gradients or shadows
- Terracotta and Mustard pop beautifully on dark backgrounds

### Illustration Elements Library

**Human Elements:**
- Profile silhouettes (side view faces)
- Abstract human figures in thought/motion
- Hands pointing, writing, gesturing
- Simple body outlines

**Knowledge & Growth:**
- Open books, stacked books
- Lightbulbs (ideas)
- Brains with organic elements (leaves, sprouts)
- Graduation caps, academic symbols

**Nature & Organic:**
- Botanical leaves and plants
- Sprouting seedlings
- Organic flowing vines
- Tree branches

**Technology (Humanized):**
- Gears and cogs (hand-drawn style)
- Speech bubbles, chat icons
- Magnifying glasses
- Simple circuit-like flowing lines
- Abstract connection dots
- Code brackets (for dev content)

**Abstract Elements:**
- Flowing continuous lines
- Small dots and circles scattered
- Organic squiggles and marks
- Starburst/radial shapes
- Curved arrows (growth, direction)
- Stars and sparkles

### Illustration Rules

1. **Always hand-drawn style** — never clean vector icons
2. **Imperfection is intentional** — wobbly lines are good
3. **Cream linework on dark** — warm, not harsh white
4. **Lines interact with color blocks** — overlap, sit on top, flow through
5. **Organic, not geometric** — rounded shapes, not sharp angles
6. **Human elements are abstract** — simple line drawings, not detailed
7. **Scattered small elements** — dots, small shapes add texture
8. **Flowing connections** — lines should flow and connect elements

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Standard Layout:** Text on left (40%), Illustrations on right (60%)

### Composition Rules

1. **Generous breathing room** — don't fill every corner
2. **Asymmetrical balance** — organic, not centered
3. **Illustrations cluster together** — create visual groupings
4. **Color blocks anchor the composition** — terracotta/mustard ground the design
5. **Cream line art flows across** — connects and unifies elements
6. **Text has breathing room** — never cramped against illustrations
7. **Small elements scatter** — dots and marks add life without clutter
8. **Warm charcoal shows through** — negative space is part of the design

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Headline** — Largest, boldest, cream serif
2. **Color blocks** — Large organic shapes draw the eye
3. **Main illustrations** — Hand-drawn cream elements tell the story
4. **Subtext** — Smaller, stone gray, supporting information
5. **Small details** — Dots, small shapes, add texture last

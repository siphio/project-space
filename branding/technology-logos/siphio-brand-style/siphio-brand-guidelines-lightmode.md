### Color Rules

1. **Background is always warm cream** (#F3F0E9) - never pure white
2. **Terracotta is the hero** - use as largest color block
3. **Mustard is the sidekick** - smaller accent shapes, never dominant
4. **Black is for linework and text only** - hand-drawn illustration style
5. **No gradients** - all color blocks are flat, solid, matte
6. **No neon or electric colors** - keep everything warm and organic

---

## Typography

### Primary Typefaces

**Headlines:** Serif typeface (Tiempos, Georgia, Freight Text, or similar)
- Warm, readable, academic credibility
- Used for main headlines and titles
- Black (#1A1A1A) color

**Body Text:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, Styrene, or similar)
- Modern, readable, friendly
- Used for subtext and descriptions
- Dark gray (#1A1A1A or #71717A)

### Typography Rules

1. Headlines should feel editorial, not corporate
2. Avoid all-caps except for small labels
3. Generous line spacing for readability
4. Text should have breathing room - never crowded
5. Serif for headlines creates academic warmth
6. Mix serif headlines with sans-serif body text

## Illustration Style

### Core Characteristics

**Hand-Drawn Black Line Art**
- Continuous line drawing style
- Imperfect, organic, human-made feeling
- Single weight or slight variation in line thickness
- Black (#1A1A1A) ink on color blocks or background

**Solid Color Blocks**
- Organic, rounded, blob-like shapes
- Imperfect edges (not perfectly geometric)
- Flat, matte, no gradients or shadows
- Shapes overlap and interact with line art

### Illustration Elements Library

**Human Elements:**
- Profile silhouettes (side view faces)
- Abstract human figures in thought/motion
- Hands pointing, writing, gesturing
- Simple body outlines

**Knowledge & Growth:**
- Open books, stacked books
- Lightbulbs (ideas)
- Brains with organic elements (leaves, sprouts)
- Graduation caps, academic symbols

**Nature & Organic:**
- Botanical leaves and plants
- Sprouting seedlings
- Organic flowing vines
- Tree branches

**Technology (Humanized):**
- Gears and cogs (hand-drawn style)
- Speech bubbles, chat icons
- Magnifying glasses
- Simple circuit-like flowing lines
- Abstract connection dots

**Abstract Elements:**
- Flowing continuous lines
- Small dots and circles scattered
- Organic squiggles and marks
- Starburst/radial shapes
- Curved arrows (growth, direction)

### Illustration Rules

1. **Always hand-drawn style** - never clean vector icons
2. **Imperfection is intentional** - wobbly lines are good
3. **Black linework only** - no colored outlines
4. **Lines interact with color blocks** - overlap, sit on top, flow through
5. **Organic, not geometric** - rounded shapes, not sharp angles
6. **Human elements are abstract** - simple line drawings, not detailed
7. **Scattered small elements** - dots, small shapes add texture
8. **Flowing connections** - lines should flow and connect elements

```

**Standard Layout:** Text on left (40%), Illustrations on right (60%)

### Composition Rules

1. **Generous whitespace** - don't fill every corner
2. **Asymmetrical balance** - organic, not centered
3. **Illustrations cluster together** - create visual groupings
4. **Color blocks anchor the composition** - large shapes ground the design
5. **Line art flows across** - connects and unifies elements
6. **Text has breathing room** - never cramped against illustrations
7. **Small elements scatter** - dots and marks add life without clutter

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Headline** - Largest, boldest, black serif
2. **Color blocks** - Large organic shapes draw the eye
3. **Main illustrations** - Hand-drawn elements tell the story
4. **Subtext** - Smaller, gray, supporting information
5. **Small details** - Dots, small shapes, add texture last
